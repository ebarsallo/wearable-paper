@inproceedings{Blanda2015,
abstract = {The paper focuses on a fuzzing approach that can be used to uncover different types of vulnerabilities inside multiple core system components of the Android OS. The paper will introduce the general idea behind this approach and how it applies to several real-life targets from the Android OS backed up by discovered vulnerabilities. The list of components that were targeted and found vulnerable contains: the Stagefright framework, the mediaserver process, the Android APK install process, the installd daemon, dex2oat, ART. A number of topics will be covered, starting with the actual fuzzing process with the data/seed generation processes and test case execution, the logging and triage mechanisms, addressing challenges such as bug reproducibility, sorting out unique issues and prioritizing issues based on their severity. The second part of the paper will take the discussion towards explaining the creation of several tools that have been developed using this methodology. The actual implementation of the tools will be discussed with focus on the technical details, as well as the issues discovered, CVE entries released and possible exploitable patterns.},

abstract = {Wearable Technology also called wearable gadget, is acategory of technology devices with low processing capabilities that can be worn by a user with the aim to provide information and ease of access to the master devices its pairing with. Such examples are Google Glass and Smart watch. The impact of wearable technology becomes significant when people start their invention in wearable computing, where their mobile devices become one of the computation sources. However, wearable technology is not mature yet in term of device security and privacy acceptance of the public. There exists some security weakness that prompts such wearable devices vulnerable to attack. One of the critical attack on wearable technology is authentication issue. The low processing due to less computing power of wearable device causethe developer's inability to equip some complicated security mechanisms and algorithm on the device.In this study, an overview of security and privacy vulnerabilities on wearable devices is presented.},
